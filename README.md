## hypotesis and technical uncertainties
I limited the project to use the free tiers of three different AI models: ChatGPT, Meta AI, and Perplexity. I documented the results of using these models to help Spanish speakers practice constructing sentences in English. I compared the results of using these models to determine which one was the most effective for this purpose. I believe I need to improve the prompting for the models to get better results.

## Technical explorations

For the diagrams I will be using excalidraw, given that it has an AI model that can generate diagrams from text, similar to using mermaid for diagrams but with more flexibility. I was able to generate good initial prompts for the AI models, but they need to be improved for consistency, so far ChatGPT has been the most consistent in the responses.

## final outcomes

I will be working on improving the prompting for the models to get better results. I will also be working with actual students to get feedback on the models and make improvements based on their feedback. Given accessiblity to the models is important, I will be working on making the models more accessible on mobile devices, specifically Meta AI.
