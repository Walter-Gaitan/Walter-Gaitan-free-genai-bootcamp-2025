### Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure. The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will significantly increase in the future if hosted in the cloud. Additionally, the company wants to keep costs predictable and on a single on-prem server.

The company is planning to invest about $10,000 to $20,000 to support approximately 200 to 300 students across Latin America. This investment aims to provide these students with access to GenAI resources and infrastructure, ensuring they have the necessary tools to succeed in their studies and projects.

### Assumptions

We are assuming that the investment will be enough to run the required hardware and that there will be only one server with no redundancy, but it should be sufficient to meet the needs of the students while keeping costs within the budget.

### Data Strategy

The company plans to implement a robust data strategy to ensure the privacy and security of user data. This includes encrypting all data at rest and in transit, implementing strict access controls, and establishing data retention policies to ensure that data is only kept for as long as necessary and is securely deleted when no longer needed. The company will also ensure that no copyrighted material is used without proper authorization, maintaining compliance with intellectual property laws. The goal is to create a secure and compliant environment that protects user data while enabling the students to leverage GenAI resources effectively.

### Considerations

The company is considering using open-source software to reduce costs and increase flexibility. This includes using open-source machine learning frameworks, databases, and other tools to build and deploy GenAI resources. To do so, GPT-4o will be considered since it can run on-premises and is integrated with Visual Studio Code. This will allow the company to leverage the power of GPT-4o while keeping costs predictable and within budget.
