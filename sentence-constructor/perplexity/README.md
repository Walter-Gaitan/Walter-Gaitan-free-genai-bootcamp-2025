### Prompting Guides

It appears that Perplexity does not have any special prompting requirements to best understand context like other models.

## Initial results

The cat is under the table.
Vocabulary Table
Spanish	English	Pronunciation (for Spanish speakers)
gato	cat	/kæt/ (cat)
debajo	under	/ˈʌn.dər/ (án-der)
mesa	table	/ˈteɪ.bəl/ (téi-bol)
Sentence Structure

[Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Object].
Clues and Considerations

    The verb “is” in this case refers to location, so you should use the correct form of “estar.”
    “Under” is a preposition indicating position beneath something.

> Student input: The cat I am on the table.

## Next Steps

Your sentence says: "The cat I am on the table."
Mistakes:

    "estoy" → "Estoy" is the first-person singular form ("I am"), but the subject is "el gato" (third person). You need the correct form of "estar" for "el gato."
    "en" instead of "debajo de" → "En la mesa" means "on the table," but the sentence says "under the table."

Try again.

## Feedback

Overall, results are more simple than when using Meta AI, I believe it is more easy to understand for someone asimilating the language.

After using it more, I discovered it doesn't keep consistency in the language responses, sometimes it will respond in Spanish and sometimes in English. This can be confusing for the student. I would recommend using Meta AI for a more consistent experience. Will try and revisit this model after improving the prompting.
