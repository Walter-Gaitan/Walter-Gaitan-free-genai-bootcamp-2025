    - BAD: The sentence is correct, but the student did not use the vocabulary table
    - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary, it should start by showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the hints, we should not provide the polite form of the verbs, because the student needs to discover it.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we really want something conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Past-verb]?

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here is a possible vocabulary table to start with:
    | Spanish | English | Phonetic      |
    |---------|---------|---------------|
    | osos    | bears   | bers          |
    | puerta  | door    | dor           |
    | basura  | garbage | gar-bech     |
    | dejar   | leave   | liv           |

    Now, let's think about the structure of the sentence. We have two clauses: "The bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage outside?".
    For the first clause, we can use the verb "estar" which means "to be present". We will need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
    For the second clause, we can use the verb "dejar" which is a more polite way of saying "leave behind". Again, we will need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

    Here is a possible sentence structure:

    [Clause 1: The bears are at the door]
    [Subject] are at [Location]
    [Clause 2: did you leave the garbage outside?]
    [Verb] the [Object] outside?

    Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the provided vocabulary and sentence structure?

    Cheat sheet:
    | Spanish | English | Phonetics           | Type |
    |---------|---------|---------------------|------|
    | oso     | bear    | bers                | Noun |
    | puerta  | door    | dor                 | Noun |
    | basura  | garbage | gar-bech           | Noun |
    | estar   | to be (location) | eh-star    | Intransitive Verb |
    | dejar   | leave   | liv                 | Transitive Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Past-verb]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is indicating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - try a response
    - ask for hints about location marking
    - ask for hints about connecting two sentences
    - ask for hints about forming questions
    - ask for hints about verb conjugation
