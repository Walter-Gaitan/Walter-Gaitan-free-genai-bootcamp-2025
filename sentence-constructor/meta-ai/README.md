Clues and Considerations
------------------------

-   Start by identifying the time in the sentence. What word indicates when something happened?

-   Consider the verb in the first sentence. What tense is it in your native language? How might that tense be expressed in English?

-   Look at the second sentence. What is the crow doing? How can you express that action in English?

-   Think about how to describe the garden in English. How can you show that it belongs to the speaker?

-   Pay attention to the word order in your sentences. Does it match the sentence structure provided?

> Student input: did you saw the crow this morning, he is looking our garden.

## Next Steps

Excellent attempt! Let's break down what you've written:
Interpretation of Your Sentence
You've written: "Did you saw the crow this morning, he is looking our garden."
Here's how a native English speaker might understand your sentence:

    "Did you saw" should be "Did you see" (subject-verb agreement).
    "he is looking" is a good translation of "estaba mirando," but consider using the past continuous tense "was looking" to match the morning timeframe.
    "our garden" is close, but the correct adjective to use here is "our" is correct, but consider using the possessive form "ours" or rephrasing as "our garden" -> "the garden of ours" is not necessary, "our garden" is enough.

Revised Sentence
Here's a revised version of your sentence:
"Did you see the crow this morning? It was looking at our garden."
Keep practicing, and you'll get closer to natural-sounding English sentences!
Next Steps

    Focus on verb tenses and subject-verb agreement.
    Practice using the correct articles ("the," "a," etc.) and adjective forms.
    Experiment with different sentence structures to improve clarity and flow.

## Feedback

Overall, results are good. it doesn't give the response right away, but instead provides feedback on the student's response. The feedback is clear but needs improvement, since students might not understand the feedback. The model should provide more simple responses, so the student doesn't get overwhelmed.
